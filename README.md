# NX.CallDataRecord
In this project, it is necessary to charge subscribers from the cdr.txt file: 
generate a report file for each subscriber containing the number, 
tariff index, 
all calls made in calendar order with a statement of their cost according to the tariff (for unlimited, the first 300 minutes - 0r, and from 301 already calculation), 
call duration, total amount of write-off.

Unfortunately, I did not sort in calendar order.
